Develop a machine learning algorithm that will use annotated notes and published papers from researchers and oncologists to automatically classify genetic variations as tumor growths or neutral mutations. \n",

    "The biggest challenge usually for healthcare related projects is the inability to obtain patient data which is the necessary size and quality needed to train a proficient machine learning models. Most patient data is hard to obtain because of strict privacy laws which make it difficult to collect, share, and distribute this data. Since I already have the data gathered my issue is that the data I have is small in sample size. I will need to work around this problem somehow. My next challenge will be the struggle of working with textual data and trying to find patterns which can create a successful predictive model from it. \n",
